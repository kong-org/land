# Kong $LAND Token

The KONG $LAND token is an ERC20 token which, at the time of deployment, may only be freely transferred amongst $CITIZEN ERC721 holders and whitelisted contracts. 

The KONG Land DAO may, at some point in the future, opt to unlock transfers of the token broadly if that's deemed desirable.
