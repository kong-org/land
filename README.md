# Kong $LAND Token

The KONG $LAND token is an ERC20 token which, at the time of deployment, may only be freely transferred amongst $CITIZEN ERC721 holders and whitelisted contracts. 

The KONG Land DAO may, at some point in the future, opt to unlock transfers of the token broadly if that's deemed desirable.

## Testing

```
npm i
npx hardhat test
```

## Merkle Claims

Minting logic has been exposed on the $LAND contract so that different groups -- $CITIZENs, $KONG holders, KONG Cash holders, etc. -- may mint $LAND as oultined at https://forum.kong.land/t/proposal-a-new-kong-land-medium-of-exchange-land/119.
